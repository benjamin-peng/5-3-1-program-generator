# 5-3-1-program-generator
My first webdev project!
This is a program generator coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and based off of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 method for weight training based off the squat, bench, deadlift, and overhead press. A single cycle of the program is automatically generated based on user input and displayed.
